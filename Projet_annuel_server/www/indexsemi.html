			<h2 class="title">First ideas started in 2012</h2>
			<div class="entry">
			  <p>In the past 20 years I have covered a multitude of areas in the semiconductor industry with processes and devices.
				   Starting in fundamental research followed by development & application until production, in laboratories and industry. 
					 I have noticed that a barrier exist between these individual high level disciplines to bring new technology to products. 
					 Small and medium enterprises often miss the required competence/contacts to the research while the laboratories don't have the marketing 
					 service in place to promote their inventions. <br>
					 When companies get their designs processed in a foundry and something is wrong with the product, a difficult debug is required. 
					 Here all competences need to come together. Because of politics or other issues, not all information is on the table, which delays the production.<br>
					 Product improvements or cost reduction often need a small change. However, without the right knowledge this might look a huge wall. 
					 Many solutions are already available, or need small adjustments. This is rather easy while having the right process/device knowledge.   
        </p>
				<p>	   
					 In all cases it is clear that a bridge between these different disciplines is missing. I want to make this bridge with my SemiConsultor company.
